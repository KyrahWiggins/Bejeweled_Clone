# Bejeweled_Clone

***How To Play:*** “Bejeweled” is a game where gems fall to fill up a board. The player can swap any two adjacent gems to try to match three gems in a row (vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally). The matched gems then disappear, making way for new gems to fall from the top. Matching more than three gems, or causing a chain reaction of gem matches will result in more points. 
The player’s score slowly drops over time, so the player must constantly be making new matches. The game ends when no possible match can be made on the board.
